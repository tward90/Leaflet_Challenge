# USGS Earthquake Visualization


## Project Instructions
---
The primary objective of the assignment was to use publicly available USGS geoJSON data in order to visualize not only the location of the most recent (*within the last month*) earthquakes but also their magnitude and their significance.

The raw data used to generate the visualization can be found [here](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/1.0_month.geojson)

One of the most interesting and challenging aspects of this assignment was its requirement to be dynamic. Creating the front end of any web application is one of the areas where a coder can show their more artistic side and put a bit of flair into the project/assignment that wasnt necessary, but adds to the overall presentation.
